Houston Babywearing Resource THIRD Saturday Central Playdate

Join us on the third Saturday of every month at The Pure Parenting Shop (2401 Yale Street, Houston, TX). Bring your favorite carriers or ones you need help with — or come try on something new! One-on-one help will be available in addition to general babywearing demonstrations and safety discussions, as led by our babywearing leaders. We will start with our 101 part of the class at 1 pm. This will give us a chance to talk to you about some of your different options in babywearing as well as some basic functions and workings of the styles of carriers. We will follow this with breaking up into smaller groups to address questions or concerns. So whether you're curious about babywearing, an old pro, or somewhere in between, come on out and meet fellow babywearing families and we'll have some fun!

Meetings are always free and open to everyone — children of all ages are welcome!
