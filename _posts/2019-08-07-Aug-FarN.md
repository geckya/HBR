Houston Babywearing Resource First Wednesday Far North Playdate

Join us on the first Wednesday of the month at Holistic Heritage Homebirth (421 Gentry Street, Spring, TX 77373). Bring your favorite carriers, carriers you need help with, or come try on something new!  One-on-one help will be available in addition to general babywearing demonstrations and safety discussions, as led by our babywearing leaders. Whether you're curious about babywearing, an old pro, or somewhere in between, come on out and meet fellow babywearing families and we'll have some fun!

Meetings are always free and open to everyone â€” children of all ages are welcome! 

DIRECTIONS: From Gentry Street, turn into the shopping center parking lot by the sign for The Doll Hospital, look for Holistic Heritage three-quarters of the way down. Parking is free. Upon entering the building, go through the small lobby into the bigger open area for meetings.  Chairs are available, toys are in the corner for littles.
