HBR Northwest Meeting
H-E-B (28550 Hwy 290, Cypress)

This meeting is now offering carrier checkouts! If you like one of the carriers in our library, you can rent it for a month to use at home!

Join us on the fourth Thursday of the month from 10:00 am-noon at the Fairfield HEB (28550 Hwy 290, Cypress, TX 77433). You can park anywhere in the HEB Parking Lot. We will be meeting in the community room. Enter the building through the rightmost entrance (facing the building), then immediately turn right. The community room is through the snack area and down the hallway. There are also restrooms in this hallway. 

Bring your own carriers and get a fit check or try one of our carriers. 
Events are always free and open to everyone â€” children of all ages are welcome. We look forward to having you at our next meeting!
